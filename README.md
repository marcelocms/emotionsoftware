# Hearts in Motion: a program that changes just as we do

This program was created with the intention of helping those struggling with emotional issues.
Many individuals face emotional frustractions that vary from day to day, and humans often attempt to seek refuge from that strife.
The ancient Greeks believed in artistic mediums as a way of living fantasies and achieving catharthis or an emotional cleansing. Our progrm
helps aid that search for relief of intense feelings through a display of randomly suggested movies, songs, and images that help lessen
the influence of such emotions. 

The program reads a specific youtube playlist and retrieves a random video/song from that playlist and displays it to the user as a 
suggestion for them to listen to. It also reads from an array of gathered films and indicates the title for the user to look into.

Note: Look at FINAL PROJECT.py for the finished version of our program
